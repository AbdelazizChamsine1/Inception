# Inception 42 Project

This project sets up a small infrastructure with Docker Compose consisting of NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Running in a Virtual Machine (as per subject requirements)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Domain Configuration

Before running the project, you need to update the domain name in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Edit srcs/.env and replace 'your_login' with your actual 42 login
DOMAIN_NAME=your_actual_login.42.fr
```

### 2. Add Domain to Hosts File

Add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:
```
127.0.0.1 your_actual_login.42.fr
```

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
# Build and start the infrastructure
make

# To stop the containers
make down

# To clean everything and rebuild
make re

# To completely clean (including data directories)
make fclean
```

## Services

- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy with TLS (port 443)
- **WordPress**: CMS with php-fpm (port 9000)
- **MariaDB**: Database server (port 3306)

## WordPress Users

The setup creates two WordPress users:
- **site_admin**: Administrator user
- **regular_user**: Regular user

Login credentials are defined in the `.env` file.

## Data Persistence

Data is stored in:
- Database: `/home/$USER/data/mysql`
- WordPress files: `/home/$USER/data/wordpress`

## Troubleshooting

### Check container status
```bash
docker ps
```

### View logs
```bash
docker-compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml logs [service_name]
```
